## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- [x] - View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- [x] - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- [x] - Select and submit a number rating
- [x] - See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

### Screenshot

I'm a free member of FrontEnd Mentor. As such, i don't have access to the figma/sketch files. And i'm happy with that as it's a way for me to learn more on using Figma.
Here's the screenshot of the work made on figma.
The figma file is not on this repo, as you need to have a pro member on FrontEndMentor to have one.

## My process

1. I've started to get the design files from the zip file from @frontendmentor.
1. Created the design on Figma and a workable prototype ( see the gif in the screenshot)
1. Create the design with HTML and CSS to look like the figma file and use figma to get dimension.
1. Create the javascript functionnality to match the requested challenge and added my touch to it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Js

### What I learned

I learned how it can be difficult to make a prototype with figma when you need to deal with lot of clic event.

### Continued development

I didn't make it really mobile friendly, even if you can go to 320px easily, i've just added a media queries at 400px.

Even if I can have made it mobile first, more of my preset are in my react/vitejs build and not necessary in this project.
Later perhaps i will make it with React as a practice.
